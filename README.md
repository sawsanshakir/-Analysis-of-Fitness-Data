# -Analysis-of-Fitness-Data
With the explosion in fitness tracker popularity, runners all over the world are collecting data with
gadgets (smartphones, watches, etc.) to keep themselves motivated. In this project we are going to
look for answers to questions like:

•How fast, long, and intense was my run today?

•Have I succeeded with my training goals?

•Am I progressing?

•What were my best achievements?

•How do I perform compared to others?

Eleven tasks will be set to achieve the aim of the project. In addition to that, we will create, import,
clean, and analyze my data to answer the above questions.
